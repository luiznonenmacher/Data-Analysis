# Dataquest - Data Analysis

This repository contains solutions to the projects found in [dataquest.io](dataquest.io), using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

The first 13 projects are from the Data Analyst Path and focus on techniques to manipulate and analyse data. The next ones are from the Data Scientist Path and their objective is to make inferences and predictions from data. 

The projects increase in complexity over time and each one shows different skills needed for analysing data. Below are a list of projects and the skills related:
